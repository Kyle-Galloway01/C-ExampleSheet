C# Cheat Sheet
--------------

1. C#:
   - C# (pronounced as "C sharp") is a modern, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft.
   - It is designed for building robust, scalable applications targeting the .NET framework.
   - C# is widely used for developing various types of software, including desktop applications, web applications, mobile apps, games, and more.

2. Variables and Data Types:
   - Variables are used to store data in memory during program execution.
   - C# is a statically typed language, meaning you must declare the type of each variable before using it.
   - Common data types in C# include:
     - int (integer)
     - double (floating-point number)
     - string (text)
     - bool (boolean, true or false)

3. Control Flow:
   - Conditional Statements:
     - if-else statement: Executes a block of code based on a condition.
     - switch-case statement: Selects one of many blocks of code to execute.
   - Loops:
     - for loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
     - while loop: Executes a block of code while a specified condition is true.
     - do-while loop: Executes a block of code at least once, then repeats as long as a specified condition is true.

4. Arrays and Collections:
   - Arrays: Stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
   - Lists: Dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink in size.
   - Provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements efficiently.

5. Methods and Functions:
   - Methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be called multiple times.
   - Functions are methods that return a value.
   - Methods can have parameters and return types.

6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
   - Classes and Objects:
     - Classes are blueprints for creating objects.
     - Objects are instances of classes that represent real-world entities.
   - Encapsulation:
     - Encapsulates the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) of a class into a single unit.
   - Inheritance:
     - Allows a class (derived class or subclass) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (base class or superclass).
   - Polymorphism:
     - Enables objects to take on multiple forms based on their context.

7. Asynchronous Programming:
   - Asynchronous programming allows you to perform tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.
   - async and await keywords are used to define asynchronous methods and await asynchronous operations.
   - Task and Task<T> types represent asynchronous operations.

8. Serialization and Deserialization:
   - Serialization is the process of converting objects into a stream of bytes for storage or transmission.
   - Deserialization is the process of converting a stream of bytes back into objects.
   - JSON and XML are common serialization formats.
